# **Python File Operations – Program Documentation**

This collection contains **10 basic Python programs** that demonstrate essential file handling operations. These programs cover everything from creating files to handling exceptions — basically all the fundamental stuff that every beginner should know.

---

## ✅ **1. Create a text file and write user input**

This program:

* Takes the file name from the user
* Takes content from the user
* Creates the file and writes the content into it

---

## ✅ **2. Read a text file and display its content**

This program opens `test.txt` in read mode and prints its entire content to the console.

---

## ✅ **3. Append data to an existing file**

Adds a new line (`"Appended line."`) to the end of `test.txt` without overwriting the old content.

---

## ✅ **4. Count lines, words, and characters in a file**

The program:

* Reads all lines
* Counts number of lines
* Splits lines into words and counts them
* Adds up total characters

Outputs:
`Lines: x, Words: y, Characters: z`

---

## ✅ **5. Read a file line by line**

Reads `test.txt` using a loop and prints each line without extra newline characters.

---

## ✅ **6. Copy content from one file to another**

Reads content from `test.txt`
Writes it to `copy_of_test.txt`
A simple file duplication program.

---

## ✅ **7. Check if a file exists**

Uses Python’s `os.path.isfile()` to check if `test.txt` exists in the current directory.

---

## ✅ **8. Handle FileNotFoundError exception**

Attempts to open `non_existent_file.txt`.
If the file doesn't exist, a clean and friendly error message is shown.

---

## ✅ **9. Write a list of names into a file**

Writes a list of names:
`["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]`
Each name is stored on a new line in `names.txt`.

---

## ✅ **10. Read only the first 10 characters of a file**

Opens `test.txt` and prints the first **10 characters** using `read(10)`.

---

## ✅ **Outro**

This mini-collection of programs is crafted for beginners who want to get comfortable with Python’s file handling — the kind of basics that always come in handy.
